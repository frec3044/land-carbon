# Land carbon module: Detailed Rubric

## Module weight: 25 pts

Question 1:

- Full Credit: Ordered sites provided and insightful justification provided

- Partial Credit: Ordered sites provided but no or limited justification

- No Credit: No answer provided

Question 2:

- Full Credit: New table has all the correct columns and sites.  Filtering and selecting occurred in the correct location of the code to reduce data transfer from database to memory.  Tidyverse functions are used.

- Partial Credit: New table does not have correct columns and sites OR Filtering and selecting did not occur in the correct location of the code to reduce data transfer from database to memory OR Tidyverse functions are used.

- No Credit: no code or answer provided or code provided is not useful for solving the problem.

Question 3:

- Full Credit: Provides new table with only live trees and a new column with the correctly calculated carbon.  Tidyverse functions are used.

- Partial Credit: Code provided but does not filter to only have live trees and/or does not include all the steps to calculate carbon for each tree OR does not use tidyverse functions

- No Credit: no code or answer provided or code provided is not useful for solving the problem.

Question 4:

- Full Credit: Code correctly aggregates to have carbon for each year within each plot

- Partial Credit: Code provided but produce a unique value for each year for each plot combination

- No Credit: No code or answer provided or code provided is not useful for solving the problem.

Question 5:

- Full Credit: Code correctly joins tables using tidyverse code taught in class

- Partial Credit: Code provided but does not correctly join the table

- No Credit: No code or answer provided or code provided is not useful for solving the problem.


Question 6:

- Full Credit: Correctly divides by plot area and filters to the type of plot.  Uses tidyverse functions.

- Partial Credit: Code provided but does not divide by plot area and/or filters to the type of plot OR does not use tidyverse functions.

- No Credit: no code or answer provided or code provided is not useful for solving the problem.

Question 7:

- Full Credit: Code correctly aggregates from the plot to the site level using tidyverse functions

- Partial Credit: Code provided but does not correctly aggregate to the site level

- No Credit: no code or answer provided or code provided is not useful for solving the problem.

Question 8:

-   Full Credit: Plot is generated using ggplot with year on x-axis and biomass on y-axis with different colors for sites.  The appropriate geom is used.  Clear axis labels and titles are used.

-   Partial Credit: Minor errors in the plot. Plot is provided but one of the required elements missing or incorrect (colors, axes, labels, title, labels)

-   Partial Credit: Major errors in the plot. Plot is provided but multiple of the required elements missing or incorrect (colors, axes, labels, title, labels).

-   No Credit: No code submitted

Question 9:

- Full Credit: Correct site level carbon presented as a table

- Partial Credit: Code present but no table present OR carbon values are not aggregate to the site leve OR carbon values are clearly incorrect

- No Credit: No code or answer provided 

Question 10:

- Full Credit: Insightful text answer provided connects to the hypothesis and explaination in Question 1

- Partial Credit: Answer is minimal (only says yes or no).

- No Credit: No answer provided.

Quarto

-   Full Credit: HTML looks clean and nicely formatted. Plots displaying properly.

-   Partial Credit: HTML has extreme errors or formatting issues that should have been caught by a cursory review before submission

-   No Credit: No HTML submitted

GitHub

-   Full Credit: assignment found on the course GitHub, multiple commits provided, and HTML committed

-   Partial Credit: Assignment found on course GitHub, but only a single commit was provided (no evidence that the student saved and committed progress) or missing HTML on GitHub.

-   No Credit: Assignment not found on the course GitHub organization
