## NEON Woody Carbon

-   Each site has a set of plots (either "tower" or "distributed")
-   Each tree is mapped (species)
-   Each year, each tree is measured: status (live or dead) and diameter

## NEON Woody Carbon

-   Diameter can be converted to biomass using "allometric" relationships
-   Biomass can be converted to carbon (carbon = biomass x 0.5)
-   Allometric relationships are from Jenkin et al. (2004)

## NEON Woody Carbon

-   Carbon for individual trees is summed within a plot to determine the plot carbon each year
-   The summed carbon is divided by the area (m\^2) of the plot to standardize across plots of different size
-   All plots within a site averaged to get a site-level carbon for each year.

## Structure of data

-   Data is spread across multiple tables
-   The data are stored in a relational database.

## New skills

- Reading in database in R (`collect`)
- Joining tables to create data frames for analysis (`left_join`)
- Filtering on strings (`str_detect`)

## Science Question

- How much carbon is stored in a forest ecosystem and how does it differ across the U.S.?
- I am a "client" interested in the carbon storage in vegetation of different ecosystems across the continental U.S. to guide my investment in the California Carbon Market.
- Specifically, I want carbon stocks estimates from four sites in NEON
